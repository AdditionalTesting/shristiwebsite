                    <p class="copy">Urban agriculture is on the rise in Toronto as an effective and affordable mechanism to increase fruit
                        and vegetable consumption and educate citizens on healthy food guidelines. Citizens are receptive
                        to the idea of urban gardening but are often not equipped with the resources and connections to get
                        one started.</p>
                    <p class="descriptors">could an online platform support citizens in learning and sustaining an urban garden within their property?</p>

                            <p>What if there were already resources available? Can an online platform be created to foster the
                                interest and growth of urban garden participants? What needs to be true for participants
                                to join the online platform in the first place? In what ways could it increase interest?
                                Would they trust Google over the platform for searching and learning about urban gardening?
                                If they’re more comfortable with Google, what purpose does the platform have? Is an online
                                platform the best way to reach the goal anyway?</p>

                                have? What challenges will they face in creating and sustaining a garden? What do they need

                    <p>3. <strong>Resourceful:</strong> residences need easy access to resources on growing and maintaining an urban garden, and the ability to seek help</p>
                    <p>4. <strong>Visual:</strong> photos and videos displayed to present the success and engagement within a garden community</p>

                            <p>Resources are the least time-sensitive information so it is placed at the bottom. It's placed below the community garden
                            pictures because seeing the pictures would hopefully inspire the user to want to grow a new plant (for example), and seek
                            information on how to do it.</p>
