                    <p class="copy">As part of low-fidelity design work at General Assembly, I was asked to create a new brand for a hypothetical
                        outdoors company, using only the following descriptor for inspiration:</p>
                    <div id="intro_descriptors">
                        <p class="descriptors">“simple, reliable, aspirational, established”</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="copy">Below is a deep dive on how (and why) I chose to brand wool. In particular, Blue Faced Leicester (BFL)
                        wool, the best kind of
                        <strong>wool</strong> you've never heard of.</p>
                </div>

                <hr>

                <div id="research">
                    <h2>research</h2>
                    <p>Assuming there was even a market for wool took some competitive analysis. In my desire to understand
                        the “outdoor gear” market, I did extensive secondary research by looking at price, product options,
                        pitch, values, and partnerships. I took time to read about each companies' history in order to find
                        common themes, values, imagery, even words, and any core message they wanted to establish with their
                        consumers.
                    </p>
                    <div id="first-chart">
                        <img src="images/wool/googlechart.png" alt="">
                        <p> The more companies I looked into, the more categories I discovered. For example, most of the companies
                            had some form of design philosophy, something I didn't realize was a staple in the market.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Some brands conveyed athleticism with bright colours, scenic photography, and vector images. Others focused
                        on tradition with soft colours, photos of families, and use of serif font types. There was little
                        overlap. I saw an opportunity to blend warm tones with vector imagery.</p>
                    <p>Competitor brands shared common attributes that I added as features to the BFL Wool brand:</p>
                    <ul id="research-list">
                        <li>sustainable fabric</li>
                        <li>community focus</li>
                        <li>patriotic</li>
                        <li>design philosophy</li>
                    </ul>

                    <img src="images/wool/custompreset.png">

                    <p>At this point, I discovered BFL wool, its Canadian history, and its high-quality features. Almost all
                        of the leading quality brands researched were from Europe, despite the fact that Canada produces
                        quality fabric and has a rich history doing so. Their brand story was predominately serious in tone.
                        Moreover, most of the competitor products were marketed to adults. I saw an opportunity.</p>
                    <div id="intro_descriptors">
                        <p class="descriptors">why not bring european standards to canadian youth markets?</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>The features of European brands combined with BFL wool's Nova Scotian history were the basis for a brand
                        story on heritage that was authentic, patriotic, and new. I deliberately chose a fun and playful
                        image as an opportunity to stand out and connect with younger audiences.</p>

                <div id="missionstatement">
                    <h2>vision &amp; mission statement</h2>
                    <p>With a product in mind, and a good idea of where competitors stood, I went back to the descriptors of
                        the hypothetical outdoors company to flesh out its vision and mission statement. These statements
                        are important because they will be the base for making decisions on product and design features.</p>

                    <div id="mission-row1">
                        <div id="mission-column1">

                        <div id="mission-column1">
                            <p>I had little to work with, so I took the synonyms of the descriptors to brainstorm ways to define
                                the brand, highlighting words that answered the following question:</p>
                            <p>Which synonyms work well together to support what is already true about the product (its' Canadian
                                history, quality wool, etc.)?
                            </p>

                            <p class="padding-mission">Then answering the following questions related to the descriptors:</p>

                                customers will feel a connection with the imagery the products are attempting to convey →
                                the easier it is to design and build an experience to support that image

                <div id="moodboard">
                    <h2>mood board &amp; style guide</h2>
                    <p>Each of the following mood boards reflects a subjective visual representation of terms that I want my
                        brand to evoke. I gave myself little restrictions on what to look for or add to each board. One of
                        the mood boards focused on minimal design, another focused on photography, another on textures, and
                        so on.</p>
                    <div class="intro_descriptors">
                        <p class="descriptors">kiss; keep it simple stupid</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Despite enjoying the process of building each mood board, I struggled because each one was strong enough
                        on its own. As a solution, I looked for one common theme within each mood board (like colour tones
                        or specific designs) and allowed that theme to represent a component of the brand.</p>
                    <p>For example, the "50s feel" mood board shows rich and warm colours; a palette that would work well with
                        my brand's "fun, playful" imagery. I added this as part of the style guide.</p>
                    <p>Looking at the mood board on photography, I realized younger generations may associate pictures of people
                        wearing wool as unfashionable based on preconceived notions of whether wool is trendy. I decided
                        to limit pictures until there was feedback on how receptive users would be to photography.</p>

                    <p>Creating the logo was an extensive process. I looked at the fabric’s texture, the history of BFL wool, and the style guide
                    for inspiration. It was difficult to pick just one style and refine it, since every style could lead to a new kind of logo.

                            <p>The UI elements took inspiration from the texture and style of wool. For example, the icons were inspired by how strings
                            overlap each other, creating knots and shadows yet are simple and clean at its core. This helped define major features of
                            the design system with illustrative and functional iconography. Eventually creating a fun and playful shopping visual experience
                            with reactions to user inputs that are as playful as the brand.</p>
